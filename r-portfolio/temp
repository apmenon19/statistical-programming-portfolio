markdown# R Portfolio

This repository contains my R projects demonstrating data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization skills. Each project showcases different aspects of my work with R, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and statistical techniques.

Feel free to explore the projects to see examples of my coding style and analytical approach.
